## Introduction

These were the instructions: You are a data analyst working for a European trailer leasing company. Your team is responsible for analyzing data related to trailer rentals, customer preferences, and operational efficiency to optimize business strategies. The dataset provided includes information about trailer specifications, rental transactions, customer demographics, and geographic locations.

Note: Feel free to use whichever tool/language to complete this assessment and share back the results.

## Objective

The questions asked were the following:

Data Exploration
    1. How many trailers are available from each make in the dataset?
    2. What is the distribution of trailer capacities?
Data Manipulation
    1. Calculate the average duration of trailer rentals.
    2. Identify the top 3 most frequently rented trailer models.
Data Visualization
    1. Create a chart of your choice showing the distribution of trailer makes.
    2. Generate a chart of your choice to visualize the distribution of rental durations.
Performance Analysis
    1. Calculate the average utilization rate of trailers (percentage of time trailers are rented out).
    2. Determine the rental demand trends across different customer industries.
Advanced Analysis
    1. Analyze and visualize the correlation between trailer age and rental duration (the age is calculated as the difference in years between the current year and the manufacturing year).
    2. Identify any seasonal patterns in rental demand based on customer locations.
    3. Create a chart of your choice to visualize what industries have the most profitable rentals.
    
## Dataset

We were provided with three datasets, Trailers, Rentals and Customers. You can find the dataset in the repository doing:

```bash
cd caseStudyDataAnalysis/Dataset


## Dependencies

This project relies on the following Python libraries:

- **pandas**: A powerful data manipulation and analysis library.
- **numpy**: A fundamental package for scientific computing with Python.
- **matplotlib.pyplot**: A plotting library used for creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations in Python.

Make sure you have these libraries installed in your Python environment before running the code. You can install them using pip:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib

Alternatively, you can install them via Anaconda if you are using the Anaconda distribution:
```bash
conda install pandas numpy matplotlib

These libraries are essential for data manipulation, numerical computations, and data visualization tasks performed in this analysis.
